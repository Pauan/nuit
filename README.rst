Nuit (pronounced "knew it" or "new eat") is a format for describing structured text. It is short for "Nu Indented Text"

Nuit attempts to combine the ease-of-use and conciseness of YAML with the simplicity of S-expressions.

This branch only contains general information about the Nuit text format. For specific implementations, please see the other branches.

Goals
=====

1. The ability to create strings without delimiters or escaping
2. Capable of expressing arbitrary acyclic tree structures
3. Extremely concise and easy for humans to read and write
4. Simple enough to be easily understood by a computer

Nuit is general-purpose. It is intended to completely replace INI and XML in most situations.

Nuit is *not* intended to have lots of features. For that, I recommend using YAML.


Data types
==========

Nuit has only lists and strings. Lists can be nested within lists which allows for arbitrary tree structures.


Syntax
======

There are special characters that can only appear at the start of a line. They are called sigils.

The ``@`` sigil creates a list:

1. If there's any non-whitespace\ [#whitespace]_ immediately after the ``@`` it is added to the list as a string::

     Nuit  @foo
     JSON  ["foo"]

2. After the first string (if any), if there's any whitespace\ [#whitespace]_ followed by non-whitespace\ [#whitespace]_, it is treated as a new line and added to the list::

     Nuit  @foo bar
     JSON  ["foo", "bar"]

   ::

     Nuit  @ foo bar
     JSON  ["foo bar"]

   ::

     Nuit  @foo @bar qux
     JSON  ["foo", ["bar", "qux"]]

3. If the second line has a greater indent than the first line, then the second line is added to the list, otherwise it isn't::

     Nuit  @foo bar qux
             corge
     JSON  ["foo", "bar qux", "corge"]

   ::

     Nuit  @foo bar qux
           corge
     JSON  ["foo", "bar qux"]

4. Every line after the second line that has the **same indent** as the second line is added to the list::

     Nuit  @foo bar qux
             corge
             maybe
             someday
               not included
     JSON  ["foo", "bar qux", "corge", "maybe", "someday"]

5. The above rules are recursive, which allows lists to nest within lists::

     Nuit  @foo @bar qux
                  yes nou
             corge
             @maybe
               @
               someday
     JSON  ["foo", ["bar", "qux", "yes nou"], "corge", ["maybe", [], "someday"]]

----

The ``#`` sigil completely ignores the rest of the line\ [#newline]_ and everything that is indented further than the sigil::

  Nuit  #foo bar
          qux corge
         @nou yes
            maybe someday
        @not included
  JSON  ["not", included"]

----

The ``>`` and ``"`` sigils use the following indent rules:

1. It is invalid to have a non-whitespace\ [#whitespace]_ character immediately after the sigil.

2. The "index" is the indentation + the sigil + 1 (one).

3. Everything between "index" and the end of the line\ [#newline]_ is included in the sigil::

     Nuit  > foobar
     JSON  "foobar"

   ::

     Nuit  >  foobar
     JSON  " foobar"

4. If there isn't any non-whitespace\ [#whitespace]_ characters after the sigil then the first line is ignored::

     Nuit  >
     JSON  ""

   ::

     Nuit  >
             foobar
     JSON  "foobar"

5. Every following line that has an indent that is greater than or equal to "index" is included in the sigil::

     Nuit  > foobar
             quxcorge
             nou yes
     JSON  "foobar\nquxcorge\nnou yes"

   ::

     Nuit  >    foobar
                 quxcorge
                nou
              yes
     JSON  "   foobar\n    quxcorge\n   nou\n yes"

   ::

     Nuit  >
               foobar
             quxcorge
             nou yes
     JSON  "  foobar\nquxcorge\nnou yes"

6. Empty lines are also included, regardless of their indentation::

     Nuit  > foobar
             quxcorge

             nou

             yes
     JSON  "foobar\nquxcorge\n\nnou\n\nyes"

``>`` creates a string that contains everything that is included by the above indent rules.

``"`` is exactly like ``>`` except:

* Single newlines\ [#newline]_ are converted to a single space\ [#whitespace]_::

    Nuit  " foobar
            quxcorge
            nou
    JSON  "foobar quxcorge nou"

* Two or more newlines\ [#newline]_ are left unchanged::

    Nuit  " foobar

            quxcorge

            nou
    JSON  "foobar\n\nquxcorge\n\nnou"

* Within the string, ``\`` has the following meaning:

  * ``\`` at the end of the line\ [#newline]_ inserts a literal newline (``U+000A``), except at the end of the string, in which case it does nothing::

      Nuit  " foobar\
              quxcorge\
              nou\
      JSON  "foobar\nquxcorge\nnou"

  * ``\\`` inserts a literal backslash (``U+005C``)::

      Nuit  " foo\\bar
      JSON  "foo\\bar"

  * ``\s`` inserts a literal space (``U+0020``)::

      Nuit  " foobar\s
      JSON  "foobar "

  * ``\n`` inserts a literal newline (``U+000A``)::

      Nuit  " foobar\n
      JSON  "foobar\n"

    ::

      Nuit  " foobar\n
              quxcorge
      JSON  "foobar\n quxcorge"

  * ``\u`` starts a Unicode code point escape\ [#unicode]_::

      Nuit  " foo\u(20 20AC)bar
      JSON  "foo\u0020\u20ACbar"

  Any other use of ``\`` is invalid.

----

If a line does not start with any of the above sigils it is treated as a string that continues until the end of the line\ [#newline]_.

----

Whitespace\ [#whitespace]_ is *completely* ignored at the end of the line\ [#newline]_, even within strings.

Except within strings, empty lines are *completely* ignored. They don't even count for indentation.

----

There is an implicit list that contains the entire Nuit text. Which means this::

  @playlist 5 Stars
    05 - Memories of Green
    51 - Time Circuits
    55 - Undersea Palace

  @playlist 4 Stars
    47 - Battle with Magus
    53 - Sara's (Schala's) Theme
    64 - To Far Away Times

  @playlist 3 Stars
    11 - Secret of the Forest
    36 - The Brink of Time

Is the same as this JSON::

  [
    ["playlist", "5 Stars",
      "05 - Memories of Green",
      "51 - Time Circuits",
      "55 - Undersea Palace"],
    ["playlist", "4 Stars",
      "47 - Battle with Magus",
      "53 - Sara's (Schala's) Theme",
      "64 - To Far Away Times"],
    ["playlist", "3 Stars",
      "11 - Secret of the Forest",
      "36 - The Brink of Time"]
  ]

The implicit list has the same rules as an explicit list, such as: all sub-expressions must have the same indent, empty lines are ignored, etc.

----

That's it! The only thing left to describe is some Unicode stuff.


Unicode
=======

All parsers and serializers are required to support Unicode. This specification deals only with Unicode code points: the encoding used is an implementation detail.

It is *very highly* recommended to support at least UTF-8, but any Unicode encoding is acceptable (UTF-7, UTF-16, UTF-32, Punycode, etc.)

It is also *very highly* recommended to use UTF-8 as the default encoding when serializing.

----

The following Unicode code points are *always* invalid::

  # whitespace
  U+0009
  U+000B
  U+000C
  U+0085
  U+00A0
  U+1680
  U+180E
  U+2000 - U+200A
  U+2028
  U+2029
  U+202F
  U+205F
  U+3000

::

  # non-printing
  U+0000 - U+0008
  U+000E - U+001F
  U+007F - U+0084
  U+0086 - U+009F
  U+FDD0 - U+FDEF
  U+FFFE
  U+FFFF
  U+1FFFE
  U+1FFFF
  U+10FFFE
  U+10FFFF

To represent them, you must use a Unicode code point escape\ [#unicode]_.

----

The Unicode byte order mark ``U+FEFF`` is invalid everywhere except as the first character in the stream. It is used for encoding and is an implementation detail. Thus, it has no effect on indentation, is not included in strings, etc.

----

The following Unicode code points are **only** valid when using UTF-16 encoding::

  U+D800 - U+DFFF

They are **always** invalid within Unicode code point escapes\ [#unicode]_ even in UTF-16 encoding.

----

All other Unicode characters may be used freely.

----

.. [#whitespace]
   Whitespace is defined as the Unicode code point ``U+0020`` (space)


.. [#newline]
   End of line is defined as either ``EOF``, ``U+000A`` (newline), ``U+000D`` (carriage return), or ``U+000D`` followed by ``U+000A``. Parsers must convert all end of lines (excluding ``EOF``) within strings to ``U+000A``


.. [#unicode]
   A Unicode code point escape starts with ``\u(``, contains one or more strings (which must contain only the hexadecimal characters ``0123456789abcdefABCDEF``) separated by a single space\ [#whitespace]_, and ends with ``)``

   Each string is the hexadecimal value of a Unicode code point. As an example, the string ``" fob`` is the same as ``" \u(66)\u(6F)\u(62)`` which is the same as ``" \u(66 6F 62)``. Because they are *code points* and not bytes, ``\u(1D11E)`` represents the Unicode character ``ùÑû``

   Unicode code point escapes are necessary to include invalid characters (listed above). They are also useful in the situation where you don't have an easy way to insert a Unicode character directly, but you do know its code point, e.g. you can represent the string ``foo‚Ç¨bar`` as ``" foo\u(20AC)bar``


Comparison
==========

It is only natural to want to compare text formats to see which one is the "best". Unfortunately, there is no "best" format because it depends on what your needs are. So, instead, I will present what I believe to be the advantages and disadvantages of other text formats compared to Nuit.

JSON
----

In Nuit, the sender emits generic lists and strings. It's up to the receiver to parse those lists and strings in any way it wants: as a number, or a hash table, or a binary search tree, etc. This same flexibility is found in XML.

JSON, however, provides native support for unordered dictionaries, numbers, booleans, and null. This means that the *sender* can decide how the data should be structured, and the receiver has to go out of its way to change that structure.

In practice this isn't a big deal because JSON was originally designed to communicate between a server and JavaScript. Thus, using JavaScript's native notation for objects, arrays, numbers, booleans, and null, was a practical decision.

----

JSON does not have any support for comments. Nuit, however, supports both single and multi-line comments. It is also much more concise than JSON, which makes it easier to read and write. These two things combined make Nuit much better for configuration files.

As shown below, Nuit is actually shorter than JSON, even after taking into account the extra overhead from CR+LF line endings. This is because JSON requires ``"`` around every string while Nuit doesn't.

YAML
----

The next obvious comparison would be with YAML. Like JSON, YAML supports unordered dictionaries, numbers, booleans, and null. In fact, YAML is a strict superset of JSON, which means all JSON is valid YAML. Unlike JSON, YAML also supports a much cleaner syntax and a much wider variety of types, including sets and ordered dictionaries.

When it comes to raw features, YAML is clearly *drastically* better than XML, JSON, and Nuit. The primary downside of YAML is that, *precisely because* it has so many amazing features, it's also much more complicated than JSON and Nuit.

My recommendation is to use Nuit if it's good enough for your needs (because of its simplicity), but if Nuit starts to get too restrictive, switch to YAML.

XML
----

Ah, yes, XML... the only real compliment I can give is that it works passably when writing a document that has lots of text in it, such as a web page. Unfortunately, XML is terrible for *everything else*.

Just don't use XML. If you have to communicate with some other code that *already uses* XML, then you have no choice... but if you have even the slightest choice in the matter, use a better format like YAML or Nuit.

Don't use XML even if your favorite language has an XML parser and doesn't have a Nuit parser: it's easier and faster to just write your own Nuit parser rather than deal with XML.


Size comparison
===============

Let's look at a size comparison between the various text formats. It is assumed that UTF-8 is used in serialization and that the line endings are CR+LF (this is a common situation when transmitting over HTTP). The results are listed from smallest-to-largest:

Inline YAML (650 bytes)::

----

If you're after the smallest format, inline YAML wins by a *very* huge margin. Nuit and JSON are quite close to eachother. Indented YAML and XML are the worst of the bunch, by a fairly significant margin.

If you use LF or CR rather than CR+LF then Nuit is 704 bytes and Indented YAML is 748 bytes.
